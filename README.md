How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Being able to use module from other code that can handle all the data calls and be able to help in the functionality of data table was a big help in making the code run smoothly. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

My main approach when doing any project is to get something small working and then add on to it. 
We were given some starter code and the first thing I did was comment out all non-working code then started with making the picture and text load. After doing that I got the table working with fake data. 
If you know something works, then you can make small changes and debug much easier and by the end have better working code instead of writing a bunch of bugs and not knowing where to begin to fix. 
One problem at time!

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I could see how in the real world having all this data in a more readable and easier to access form can be very beneficial to a company. This program took 10000 data entries and was able to filter and display it down to a few pages. If you are looking at just man power hours saved, it may have taken me a 80 hours from start to finish, but it saves so many people much more time in the long run.
